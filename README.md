NightShift is an iOS app integrated with a FastAPI backend designed to improve the sleep quality of caregivers while ensuring prompt care for their dependents. The app intelligently selects which caregiver to wake up based on real-time sleep stage data. This aids in the care of elderly, sick individuals, and babies without unduly disturbing the caregiver's sleep.
